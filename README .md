# Medical Ethics Sharing Platform

A Django web application where users can share and discover materials related to Medical Ethics — including films, theatre plays, literary texts, clinical ethics cases, and ethics-related news. Posts go through an editor approval workflow before being published publicly.

---

## Project Overview

This platform allows registered users to submit posts in five categories. Editors (staff users) review submitted content and approve or reject it before it becomes publicly visible. The site features a dark academia aesthetic with photo backgrounds, floating particles, animated post cards, dark mode support, and a fully responsive layout.

## AI Tools Usage

AI tools (Claude by Anthropic) were used during development for:

- Generating the initial project scaffold and boilerplate Django code
- Designing the CSS theme (dark academia aesthetic, CSS variables, animations)
- Debugging template rendering issues (e.g. block placement for auth pages)
- Writing the README documentation

All code was reviewed, understood, and verified by the student. The student is responsible for understanding every part of the project and is able to explain its structure and modify it.

---

## Task Distribution

*This project was completed by 1 student.*

All tasks — project setup, models, views, forms, templates, CSS, URL routing, editor workflow, bonus features — were done by the same student.

---

## Notes

- The database file (`db.sqlite3`) is included. It may or may not contain test data.
- If the database is empty, run the setup steps above to create categories and a superuser.
- Static files are served by Django's development server (`DEBUG=True`). For production, `collectstatic` would be required.
